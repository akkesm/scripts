# My scripts collection

Just a few simple, hacked together tools that I dump here to keep track of them. They work.

Any tool, file, website or anything else these scripts are used on is likely to be [absolutely prorpietary](https://i.redd.it/7ozal346p6kz.png), this is also why descriptions are vague.

## Format-tables

A script that uses vim to format a large list of HTML files.

## Reflex Select

A script to enable selection of unselectable text fields in Reflex Web.
